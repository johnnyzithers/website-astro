    "description": "Participants took place in a two day workshop designed to teach the fundamental concepts and technologies required to design and build new MIDI controller and digital synthesizer instruments. Instrument design techniques, user interaction, and musical performance techniques were discussed within the context of traditional, modern, and experimental music instrument design. Participants left with a new instrument they designed and built themselves."

    "description": "This workshop centered around exploring the possible configurations of copper tape to capacitively sense interaction on custom designed MIDI controllers. Participants learned the fundamentals of the technologies required to design, build, and construct new MIDI instruments; electronics, digital hardware, programming, and interaction design. Participants also created a custom MIDI controller during the course of the workshop."
